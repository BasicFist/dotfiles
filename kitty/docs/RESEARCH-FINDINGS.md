## Knowledge Management Systems

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**What Are ADRs?**
- Documents capturing **reasoning behind significant architectural decisions**
- Part of Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM)
- Creates institutional memory outliving individual team members
- Captures nuanced context traditional docs miss

**Benefits:**
- **Transparency:** Clear decision rationale accessible to all
- **Reduced Conflicts:** Technical disagreements resolved by reference
- **Onboarding:** New team members understand "why" not just "what"
- **Consistency:** Architectural continuity over time
- **Knowledge Retention:** Senior architect knowledge preserved

### ADR Structure (Recommended)

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Decision Makers:** Tech Lead, Backend Team
**Consulted:** DBA, DevOps

## Context
Our application needs persistent storage for user data,
transactions, and analytics. We're choosing between
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Rich query capabilities (JSON + SQL)
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Strong community support

### Negative
- Horizontal scaling more complex than MongoDB
- Learning curve for team familiar with MySQL
- Slightly slower for pure document storage

## Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB: Better for pure document storage, but lacks ACID
- MySQL: Team familiar, but weaker JSON support

## References
- Benchmark: [link]
- Team discussion: [link]
```

### Storage Best Practices

**Location:**
```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   └── adr/              # ← ADR directory
│       ├── 0001-use-postgresql.md
│       ├── 0002-graphql-api.md
│       └── 0003-microservices.md
├── architecture/
│   └── decisions/        # ← Alternative location
└── .adr-tools/           # ← Tooling metadata
```

**Version Control:**
- Keep ADRs in **same repo as code**
- Version alongside code changes
- Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)

### Tools for Managing ADRs

**1. Log4brains**
- Open source static site generator
- Browsable, searchable ADR website
- Automatic TOC and navigation
- Markdown-based

**2. ADR Manager**
- Web-based tool
- Visualize decision dependencies
- Team collaboration features
- Search and filter

**3. Platform Integration**
- **Confluence:** Wiki-based storage, good for non-technical stakeholders
- **GitHub/GitLab:** Markdown files in repo, version controlled
- **MkDocs:** Static site generation, beautiful documentation
- **Notion/Box:** Knowledge base platforms

### ADR vs Other Docs

**ADRs are NOT:**
- API documentation (use Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Code comments (those explain "how")
- Meeting minutes (ADRs are decisions, not discussions)
- Requirements docs (ADRs are solutions, not problems)

**ADRs ARE:**
- **Why** we chose this approach
- **What** alternatives we considered
- **Trade-offs** we accepted
- **Context** at time of decision

### Decision Record Patterns

**ADR = Any Decision Record:**
- Not just architecture!
- Record **any significant decision**
- Process decisions, tool choices, methodology
- Lightweight for small teams

**Agile Decision Records:**
- Shorter format for fast-moving teams
- Focus on outcome and next steps
- Living documents (can be updated)
- Linked to user stories/epics

### Knowledge Management Integration

**Institutional Memory:**
- ADRs create knowledge that outlasts individuals
- Capture tacit knowledge (the "why")
- Build on past decisions (reference previous ADRs)
- Avoid repeating past mistakes

**Team Onboarding:**
- New members read ADRs to understand system
- Reduces "why did we do it this way?" questions
- Faster ramp-up time
- Cultural knowledge transfer

## TUI Design Patterns

### Tool Comparison: Dialog vs Whiptail

**Dialog:**
- Full-featured, highly customizable
- ncurses-based
- Rich widget set
- More control over appearance
- **Recommended for:** Complex UIs, power users

**Whiptail:**
- Lightweight alternative to dialog
- newt-based (not ncurses)
- Functionally reduced
- Included in many distros by default
- **Recommended for:** Simple UIs, minimal dependencies

**Decision:** Use both with auto-detection (our approach!)

### Common Dialog Types

**1. Message Boxes**
```bash
# Info box (auto-closes)
dialog --infobox "Processing..." 5 30

# Message box (requires OK)
dialog --msgbox "Operation complete!" 7 40
```

**2. Input Boxes**
```bash
# Text input
dialog --inputbox "Enter name:" 8 40 "default" 2> output.txt

# Password (hidden input)
dialog --passwordbox "Password:" 8 40 2> pass.txt
```

**3. Menus**
```bash
# Single selection menu
dialog --menu "Choose:" 15 50 3 \
  1 "Option A" \
  2 "Option B" \
  3 "Option C" 2> choice.txt
```

**4. Checklists / Radio Lists**
```bash
# Multiple selection
dialog --checklist "Select features:" 15 50 5 \
  1 "Feature A" off \
  2 "Feature B" on \
  3 "Feature C" off 2> selected.txt

# Single selection (radio)
dialog --radiolist "Choose one:" 15 50 3 \
  1 "Red" off \
  2 "Green" on \
  3 "Blue" off 2> color.txt
```

### Layout Best Practices

**Dimensions:**
- **Height:** Don't consume entire screen (leave context)
- **Width:** Most terminals = 80+ columns
- **Rule of thumb:** Max 60-70% of screen space
- **Validation:** Test on 80x24 terminals (minimum standard)

**Navigation:**
- **Tab key:** Switch between UI elements
- **Space:** Select/toggle checkboxes
- **Enter:** Confirm selection
- **Esc:** Cancel/go back

**User Experience:**
- Add informative messages
- Provide default values
- Use consistent terminology
- Clear button labels ("OK", "Cancel", not "Yes", "No")

### Boxlib: Abstraction Layer

**Purpose:** Write once, run with Dialog OR Whiptail

**Benefits:**
- Less boilerplate code
- Backend-agnostic
- Easier maintenance
- Portable across systems

**Example:**
```bash
source boxlib.sh

# Works with either dialog or whiptail
box_msgbox "Title" "Message"
box_inputbox "Enter name:" "Default"
box_menu "Choose:" "1" "Option 1" "2" "Option 2"
```

### Advanced Patterns

**Form-Based Input:**
```bash
# Multi-field forms
dialog --form "User Info" 15 50 5 \
  "Name:"     1 1 ""          1 10 30 0 \
  "Email:"    2 1 ""          2 10 30 0 \
  "Company:"  3 1 ""          3 10 30 0 2> form.txt
```

**Progress Indicators:**
```bash
# Gauge (progress bar)
for i in {1..100}; do
  echo $i
  sleep 0.1
done | dialog --gauge "Processing..." 7 50

# Dynamic updates
dialog --progressbox "Installing..." 20 70 < install.log
```

**File Browsing:**
```bash
# File selection
dialog --fselect /home/user/ 15 70 2> selected_file.txt

# Directory selection
dialog --dselect /home/user/ 15 70 2> selected_dir.txt
```

### Error Handling

**Input Validation:**
```bash
while true; do
  dialog --inputbox "Enter number (1-10):" 8 40 2> num.txt
  num=$(cat num.txt)

  if [[ $num =~ ^[1-9]$|^10$ ]]; then
    break
  else
    dialog --msgbox "Invalid! Enter 1-10" 7 30
  fi
done
```

**Exit Code Handling:**
```bash
dialog --yesno "Continue?" 7 30
result=$?

case $result in
  0) echo "User selected Yes" ;;
  1) echo "User selected No" ;;
  255) echo "User pressed ESC" ;;
esac
```

### Integration with jq

**Powerful Combination:** TUI + jq for JSON data

```bash
# Read JSON, present menu, update JSON
items=$(jq -r '.[] | "\(.id) \"\(.name)\""' data.json)
eval dialog --menu "Select:" 15 50 5 $items 2> choice.txt
selected=$(cat choice.txt)

# Update JSON based on selection
jq --arg id "$selected" '.[] | select(.id==$id)' data.json
```

## Consensus Building Techniques

### Voting Methods for Software Teams

**1. Dot Voting**
- **Use Case:** Selecting multiple options from list
- **How:** Each person gets dots (stickers/marks), places on preferred options
- **Best For:** Feature prioritization, backlog grooming
- **Advantage:** Visual, fast, allows multiple preferences

**2. Roman Voting (Thumbs)**
- **Use Case:** Quick yes/no decisions
- **How:** Thumbs up = yes, down = no, sideways = abstain
- **Best For:** Meeting decisions, quick approvals
- **Advantage:** Immediate visual consensus check

**3. Fists of Five**
- **Use Case:** Gauging consensus degrees
- **How:**
  - 5 fingers = Strongly agree
  - 4 = Agree
  - 3 = Neutral/can live with it
  - 2 = Disagree but won't block
  - 1 = Strongly disagree, need discussion
  - 0 (fist) = Veto/block
- **Best For:** Important decisions needing buy-in
- **Advantage:** Shows strength of agreement, identifies concerns

### The 1-2-4-All Approach

**Pattern:** Individual → Pair → Group → All

**Steps:**
1. **1 (Individual):** Think alone, write down ideas (2-3 min)
2. **2 (Pairs):** Share with partner, discuss (3-5 min)
3. **4 (Groups):** Combine pairs, find common ground (5-7 min)
4. **All (Team):** Share insights, build consensus (10-15 min)

**Best For:**
- Important decisions
- When team is nowhere near consensus
- Ensuring all voices heard
- Avoiding groupthink

**Benefits:**
- Introverts get thinking time
- Ideas refined before full group
- Builds on each other's thoughts
- Natural consensus emerges

### Facilitation Techniques

**Small Group Breakouts:**
- Split large team into 3-5 person groups
- Each group discusses independently
- Reconvene to share findings
- **Benefit:** More airtime per person

**Ritual Dissent:**
- Present idea
- Team identifies **only concerns/risks** (5 min)
- Presenter listens silently
- Presenter refines based on feedback
- **Benefit:** Surface hidden concerns early

**Anonymous Contribution:**
- Use tools (Mural, Miro, shared doc)
- Submit ideas/votes anonymously
- Discuss after collection
- **Benefit:** Remove social pressure, rank influence

### Decision-Making Frameworks

**RAPID** (Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide)
- **Best For:** Authoritative teams, clear leadership
- **R:** Recommends action
- **A:** Agrees to recommendation
- **P:** Performs the work
- **I:** Provides input
- **D:** Decides (final authority)
- **Strength:** Clear ownership, fast decisions

**DACI** (Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed)
- **Best For:** Inclusive teams, complex decisions
- **D:** Driver owns decision process
- **A:** Approver has final say
- **C:** Contributors provide input
- **I:** Informed after decision
- **Strength:** All voices involved at right stage

**Consensus Model**
- **Best For:** Teams valuing inclusion, important decisions
- **Process:** Discussion → Proposal → Concerns → Refinement → Agreement
- **Requirement:** All must agree (or at least "can live with it")
- **Strength:** High buy-in, thorough discussion
- **Weakness:** Can be slow

**OODA** (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
- **Best For:** Fast-moving, adaptive teams
- **Process:** Rapid cycle through 4 phases
- **Strength:** Quick adaptation, avoids paralysis
- **Use Case:** Crisis response, competitive markets

### Harvard Consensus-Building Approach

**Process:**
1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Neutral facilitator guides
   - All parties agree on problem statement
   - Clarify scope and constraints

2. **Procedure Agreement:**
   - How will we deliberate?
   - Ground rules for discussion
   - Timeline and milestones

3. **Education Phase:**
   - Share context and background
   - Technical information
   - Articulate interests (not positions)

4. **Deliberation:**
   - Explore options
   - Discuss trade-offs
   - Identify areas of agreement

5. **Agreement:**
   - Draft working agreement
   - Revise based on feedback
   - Final consensus

**Single-Text Method:**
- Introduce working draft early
- All parties discuss and revise
- Provides focal point
- Identifies agreement/disagreement areas
- **Best For:** Technical/regulatory language, many stakeholders

### Supporting Tools

**RACI Matrix:**
- **R:** Responsible (does the work)
- **A:** Accountable (final authority)
- **C:** Consulted (provides input)
- **I:** Informed (kept updated)

**Use:** Clarify roles before decision-making

**Decision Log:**
- Record all decisions
- Include date, participants, rationale
- Reference in future discussions
- Build institutional knowledge

### Key Takeaway

**No universal "best" framework** - choose based on:
- Team culture (authoritative vs. democratic)
- Decision importance (minor vs. strategic)
- Time constraints (urgent vs. planned)
- Stakeholder count (small vs. large)
- Need for buy-in (execution vs. exploration)
