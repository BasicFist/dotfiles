# Kitty Wallpapers

- Store curated, version-worthy wallpapers directly in this directory.
- Use subdirectories like `generated/` or `tmp/` for large or ephemeral exports; those paths stay ignored.
- Prefer lossless PNG for neon themes; compress with `optipng` or `pngquant` before committing.
- Update `kitty.d/theme-*.conf` if new wallpapers are referenced so the dependency is obvious.
